#In Python, the with statement replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand. More importantly, it ensures closing resources right after processing them. A common example of using the with statement is reading or writing to a file
# loading csv file 1. read file
def load_file():
	with open ('data.csv', 'r', encoding='ISO-8859-1') as file:
		reader_obj = csv.reader(file, delimiter = ',')
		data = list(reader_obj) # convert the obj to list
		return data

# 2. convert to numpy array
#data_array = np.array(data, dtype = object) #file has string+numbers so use object type
'''However, this will create an array of strings. If your CSV file contains numerical data, youâ€™ll want to convert these strings to the appropriate numerical type. You can do this by specifying the dtype parameter in the np.array function.'''
#print (data_array[:5])
